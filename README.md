# Parallel GCN
Parallel implementation of Graph Convolutional Networks ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf) and [blog](http://tkipf.github.io/graph-convolutional-networks/)) on CPU from scratch.

A course project of [CMU 15-618: Parallel Computer Architecture and Programming](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~418/) in 2019 Spring, by Liwei Cai (me) and Chengze Fan ([@ccczzzf](https://github.com/ccczzzf)).
